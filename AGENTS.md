# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

# Testing

Use `.venv` virtual environment to run tests. Prefer to load the environment variables from the `.env` file for testing purposes. Use `pytest` with required parameters to run tests.
